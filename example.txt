Blocking and Non-Blocking

Blocking code:

       Blocking code executes line by line, waiting for the current operation to complete before moving to the next one.

Non-Blocking code:

       Non-blocking code does not wait; it uses callbacks, promises, or async/await to continue executing other code.
